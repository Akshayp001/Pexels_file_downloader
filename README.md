## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Flutter & Dart**: Core framework and language
- **Provider**: State management solution for reactive and efficient UI updates
- **Dio**: HTTP client for API requests and file downloads
- **path_provider**: Managing file system locations
- **open_file**: Handling file opening operations
- **flutter_staggered_animations**: Creating beautiful animations for list/grid items
- **animated_splash_screen**: Custom splash screen implementation
- **shared_preferences**: Persistent storage for app settings

## üìö API Used

This app integrates with the [Pexels API](https://api.pexels.com/v1/) via Pexels to fetch high-quality images, videos, and other media files. The API provides:

- High-resolution stock photos and videos
- Extensive search capabilities
- Detailed file metadata
- Free tier with generous request limits

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & State Management

The app follows a clean architecture approach with:

- **Repository Pattern**: Abstracts data sources and provides a clean API for the UI
- **Service Layer**: Handles API communication and file download operations
- **Provider State Management**: Manages UI state and provides reactive updates
- **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)**: Separates business logic from UI components

The Provider package was chosen for state management due to its:
- Simplicity and ease of implementation
- Efficient rebuilding of only the affected UI components
- Good integration with Flutter's widget lifecycle
- Scalability for the app's feature set
